Title: Sports Score Management App

Short description:

•	For login, registration, password resets, and two-factor authentication with e-mail code delivery, I used Microsoft Identity. 

• After successful authentication, the token is returned and stored in local storage.

• I used Bearer authentication on the front end regarding the authorization based on the role (Admin, User).

•	The user chooses a sport and views the matches. Each match displays the scores.

•	There are add editing options only for the admin.

•	Technologies: SSMS, Ionic (Angular), and ASP.NET Core API.
